Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: To have an extra backup or for easier collaboration with others. Also makes your code accessible if you're working on more than one machine.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Automatically pulling from the remote repository might overwrite some in-progress work you were trying out locally that wasn't ready for public viewing.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Branching occurs in one repository. Clones and forks are similar, but forks are a type of clone exclusive to GitHub and only makes a copy on the GitHub servers. To get that forked repository on to your local machine you would still need to clone it from your GitHub account. You would use a fork when you don't have permission to update a repository but you want to give credit to the original author. 

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: You can still refer to it if you don't have internet access since it's stored locally.
