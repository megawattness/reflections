Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git folder within the folder. You need to do it so you can begin tracking versions of your files.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files that will be committed to the repository. The working directory might contain additional files that wouldn't be tracked. 

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can check which files have changed since last commit. Git status will show updated files that haven't been added to the staging area yet.

Q: What are some situations where branches would be useful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When introducing new features, like translating to a different language (italian) or introducing a different difficulty level for a game. Branches help keep track of those different changes without risk of "breaking" the whole working portion.

Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Seeing a drawing lets you trace the path for each branch. It makes it easier to see where different tracks split and what point they have in common.
