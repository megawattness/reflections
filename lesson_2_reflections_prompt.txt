Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git folder within the folder. You need to do it so you can begin tracking versions of your files.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files that will be committed to the repository. The working directory might contain additional files that wouldn't be tracked.
